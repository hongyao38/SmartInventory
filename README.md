Built a docker image of our application using cloud containers
This way it will be easier to deploy our app when we are done
To run the app, instead of using "mvnw spring-boot:run"
just type "docker compose up"
Note1: Make sure you have docker running in the background
Note2: Stop your local MySQL service from services.msc
